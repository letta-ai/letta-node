The Letta TypeScript library provides convenient access to the Letta API from TypeScript.

## Installation

```sh
npm i -s letta
```

## Reference

A full reference for this library is available [here](./reference.md).

## Handling errors

When the library is unable to connect to the API,
or if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),
a subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
async function main() {
  const agentStates = await client.agents.list().catch(async (err) => {
    if (err instanceof Letta.APIError) {
      console.log(err.status); // 400
      console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError
      console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}
    } else {
      throw err;
    }
  });
}

main();
```

Error codes are as followed:

| Status Code | Error Type                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |
| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |

### Retries

Certain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.
Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict,
429 Rate Limit, and >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.

You can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Configure the default for all requests:
const client = new Letta({
  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2
});

// Or, configure per-request:
await client.agents.list({
  maxRetries: 5,
});
```

### Timeouts

Requests time out after 1 minute by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Configure the default for all requests:
const client = new Letta({
  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 1 minute)
});

// Override per-request:
await client.agents.list({
  timeout: 5 * 1000,
});
```

On timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.

Note that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).

## Advanced Usage

### Accessing raw Response data (e.g., headers)

The "raw" `Response` returned by `fetch()` can be accessed through the `.asResponse()` method on the `APIPromise` type that all methods return.

You can also use the `.withResponse()` method to get the raw `Response` along with the parsed data.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
const client = new Letta();

const response = await client.agents.list().asResponse();
console.log(response.headers.get('X-My-Header'));
console.log(response.statusText); // access the underlying Response object

const { data: agentStates, response: raw } = await client.agents.list().withResponse();
console.log(raw.headers.get('X-My-Header'));
console.log(agentStates);
```

### Making custom/undocumented requests

This library is typed for convenient access to the documented API. If you need to access undocumented
endpoints, params, or response properties, the library can still be used.

#### Undocumented endpoints

To make requests to undocumented endpoints, you can use `client.get`, `client.post`, and other HTTP verbs.
Options on the client, such as retries, will be respected when making these requests.

```ts
await client.post("/some/path", {
    body: { some_prop: "foo" },
    query: { some_query_arg: "bar" },
});
```

#### Undocumented request params

To make requests using undocumented parameters, you may use `// @ts-expect-error` on the undocumented
parameter. This library doesn't validate at runtime that the request matches the type, so any extra values you
send will be sent as-is.

```ts
client.foo.create({
    foo: "my_param",
    bar: 12,
    // @ts-expect-error baz is not yet public
    baz: "undocumented option",
});
```

For requests with the `GET` verb, any extra params will be in the query, all other requests will send the
extra param in the body.

If you want to explicitly send an extra argument, you can do so with the `query`, `body`, and `headers` request
options.

#### Undocumented response properties

To access undocumented response properties, you may access the response object with `// @ts-expect-error` on
the response object, or cast the response object to the requisite type. Like the request params, we do not
validate or strip extra properties from the response from the API.

### Customizing the fetch client

By default, this library uses `node-fetch` in Node, and expects a global `fetch` function in other environments.

If you would prefer to use a global, web-standards-compliant `fetch` function even in a Node environment,
(for example, if you are running Node with `--experimental-fetch` or using NextJS which polyfills with `undici`),
add the following import before your first import `from "Letta"`:

```ts
// Tell TypeScript and the package to use the global web fetch instead of node-fetch.
// Note, despite the name, this does not add any polyfills, but expects them to be provided if needed.
import "@letta-ai/letta/shims/web";
import Letta from "@letta-ai/letta";
```

To do the inverse, add `import "@letta-ai/letta/shims/node"` (which does import polyfills).
This can also be useful if you are getting the wrong TypeScript types for `Response` ([more details](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-node/tree/main/src/_shims#readme)).

### Logging and middleware

You may also provide a custom `fetch` function when instantiating the client,
which can be used to inspect or alter the `Request` or `Response` before/after each request:

```ts
import { fetch } from "undici"; // as one example
import Letta from "@letta-ai/letta";

const client = new Letta({
    fetch: async (url: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit): Promise<Response> => {
        console.log("About to make a request", url, init);
        const response = await fetch(url, init);
        console.log("Got response", response);
        return response;
    },
});
```

Note that if given a `DEBUG=true` environment variable, this library will log all requests and responses automatically.
This is intended for debugging purposes only and may change in the future without notice.

### Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)

By default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around 100ms off most requests.

If you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests (be they http or https), for example:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
import http from 'http';
import { HttpsProxyAgent } from 'https-proxy-agent';

// Configure the default for all requests:
const client = new Letta({
  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),
});

// Override per-request:
await client.agents.list({
  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),
});
```

## Semantic versioning

This package generally follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions:

1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.
2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals)_.
3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in practice.

We take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely on a smooth upgrade experience.

We are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/letta-ai/letta-node/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.

## Requirements

TypeScript >= 4.5 is supported.

The following runtimes are supported:

-   Web browsers (Up-to-date Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and more)
-   Node.js 18 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.
-   Deno v1.28.0 or higher.
-   Bun 1.0 or later.
-   Cloudflare Workers.
-   Vercel Edge Runtime.
-   Jest 28 or greater with the `"node"` environment (`"jsdom"` is not supported at this time).
-   Nitro v2.6 or greater.

Note that React Native is not supported at this time.

If you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.

## Usage

Instantiate and use the client with the following:

```typescript
import { LettaClient } from "letta";

const client = new LettaClient({ token: "YOUR_TOKEN" });
await client.tools.create({
    source_code: "source_code",
});
```

## Request And Response Types

The SDK exports all request and response types as TypeScript interfaces. Simply import them with the
following namespace:

```typescript
import { Letta } from "letta";

const request: Letta.ToolUpdate = {
    ...
};
```

## Exception Handling

When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of the following error
will be thrown.

```typescript
import { LettaError } from "letta";

try {
    await client.tools.create(...);
} catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof LettaError) {
        console.log(err.statusCode);
        console.log(err.message);
        console.log(err.body);
    }
}
```

## Advanced

### Additional Headers

If you would like to send additional headers as part of the request, use the `headers` request option.

```typescript
const response = await client.tools.create(..., {
    headers: {
        'X-Custom-Header': 'custom value'
    }
});
```

### Retries

The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
as the request is deemed retriable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
retry limit (default: 2).

A request is deemed retriable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

-   [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
-   [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
-   [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

```typescript
const response = await client.tools.create(..., {
    maxRetries: 0 // override maxRetries at the request level
});
```

### Timeouts

The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeoutInSeconds` option to configure this behavior.

```typescript
const response = await client.tools.create(..., {
    timeoutInSeconds: 30 // override timeout to 30s
});
```

### Aborting Requests

The SDK allows users to abort requests at any point by passing in an abort signal.

```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();
const response = await client.tools.create(..., {
    abortSignal: controller.signal
});
controller.abort(); // aborts the request
```

### Runtime Compatibility

The SDK defaults to `node-fetch` but will use the global fetch client if present. The SDK works in the following
runtimes:

-   Node.js 18+
-   Vercel
-   Cloudflare Workers
-   Deno v1.25+
-   Bun 1.0+
-   React Native

### Customizing Fetch Client

The SDK provides a way for your to customize the underlying HTTP client / Fetch function. If you're running in an
unsupported environment, this provides a way for you to break glass and ensure the SDK works.

```typescript
import { LettaClient } from "letta";

const client = new LettaClient({
    ...
    fetcher: // provide your implementation here
});
```

## Contributing

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code,
otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as
a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening
an issue first to discuss with us!

On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!
